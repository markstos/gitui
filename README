A simple, darcs-esque UI for interactions with git.  To use it, install
and call sub-commands with 'git i'.  It currently only handles adding
new files and committing existing files.  You can get help on the
commands by doing `git i help`, or by hitting '?' when running one of
the commands.

Available commands:
add:  Add files to the repository
record:  Record changes (stages and commits) interactively
